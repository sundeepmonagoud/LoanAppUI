 - Elmah Logging : Will write all log info to file. Handles Application level error handling.
 - MS Unit Testing : for Unit testing the controller api.
- BAL
 -Query layer : Used query for building query for multiple tables formats data and sends the response to Controller.
- Data Objects: Transforms Database Objects into Data objects.

-DAL:
  - Entityframe work : Used Entityframe work code first approach for connecting to database for retrieval and updating databse
 - Database Objects: Tables of the database represented in class for querying.

Whats could I implement?


DAL - 
1.	 Create a generic DAL layer using repository pattern.
2.	Create repository pattern

API : 
1.	Would implement Antiforgery token 
2.	Enable CORS to specific website

Angular :
1.	I would write test case for all the scenarios and see the code coverage
2.	Capturing the errors globally. 
3.	ngrxstore for Error Message. I would create a error component and load it on App component and map it to Error store. So, if any error occurs, this control will automatically displays the message to user. 
4.	Implement Authentication using JWT token 
5.	Would configure CSP as Self. So that data from no other website can be loaded
6.	We could implement login and authentication process to secure the app. 


Run Application :
Angular : 
(*Note:Please configure the end point in environment.ts file. Default endpoint is https://localhost:44325/api/ )
1.	Npm install
2.	Npm start
.Net Core 
1.	Launch in debug mode or Host in IIS
Database Deployment:
Run below commands to deploy db changes to “LoanDB” or I have attached db file in LoanApp.WebAPI/App_Data
